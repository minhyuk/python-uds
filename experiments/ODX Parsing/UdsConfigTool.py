"""
This script is an experimental file demonstrating a potential approach to UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) communication flow through code generation. The purpose is to illustrate how an auto-coder could generate the system's code structure.

Key Components:
- The script consists of various functions and methods related to parsing XML data and creating dynamic functions for the request data handling.
- Functions are included to extract relevant information from XML elements, define UDS connection, and interact with diagnostic services.
- Dynamic functions like creating session control requests, read data by identifier requests, and write data by identifier requests are generated based on XML content.
- Method factories for various request methods (createRequestMethod, fillDictionary, create_udsConnection) handle the flow of UDS communication, including positive and negative response handling.
- The 'RequestMethodFactory' creates UDS request methods dynamically based on the service ID, allowing for request generation and response analysis.

Execution and Output:
- The script initiates UDS connection creation based on the XML content provided.
- Dynamic methods are created and invoked for reading data by identifier operations, based on the extracted information.
- The script displays information about the ECU serial number read operation using the 'readDataByIdentifier' method.
