"""
This Python script defines an abstract base class named ITimer using the abc module to create a template for implementing timer functionalities. The class outlines a set of abstract methods that define the core operations and behaviors expected from any concrete timer class that inherits from ITimer.

Key components of the script include:
1. ITimer class: An abstract base class (ABC) that serves as an interface defining essential timer methods without implementing their functionality. The class consists of abstract methods for starting a timer, restarting a timer, stopping a timer, checking if the timer has expired, and determining if the timer is currently running.

By defining these abstract methods, the ITimer class establishes a contract that any concrete timer class must adhere to by providing implementations for these fundamental timer operations. It enforces a consistent interface for timer objects and ensures that specific timer classes implement the required functionalities to manage timers effectively.

Overall, this script sets the foundation for creating custom timer classes by defining a standard interface through the ITimer abstract base class, promoting modularity and extensibility in timer implementations.
