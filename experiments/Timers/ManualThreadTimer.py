"""
This Python script is an experimental code snippet created to test the threading functionality for implementing a timer mechanism. The file defines a ManualThreadTimer class, which uses a threading.Thread object to manage a timer with a specified timeout duration and monitor its status throughout execution.

Key components of the script include:
1. ManualThreadTimer class: An implementation of the ITimer interface, this class contains methods for initiating, restarting, and monitoring the threaded timer. It provides functions to start the timer thread, track the timer's expiration status, and determine if the timer is currently active or running.

The script conducts an experiment by creating an instance of the ManualThreadTimer class with a timeout value of 0.001 seconds. It iterates over multiple timer runs to evaluate the timer's performance, calculating and displaying statistics such as the minimum, maximum, and average time taken for each timing cycle.

Overall, the file serves as a test environment for exploring the usage and behavior of threaded timers in Python, offering insights into the functioning and efficiency of timers managed using threading.Thread objects.
