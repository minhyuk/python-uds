"""
This Python script is an experimental code snippet designed to explore the functionality of threading for implementing a timer mechanism. The file defines a ThreadTimer class that utilizes the threading.Timer class to manage a timer with specified timeout duration and monitor the timer's status.

Key components of the script include:
1. ThreadTimer class: This class implements the ITimer interface and provides methods for managing the threading-based timer functionality. It includes methods to start, restart, and stop the timer, as well as check whether the timer has expired or is currently running.

The script conducts an experiment by creating an instance of the ThreadTimer class with a timeout value of 0.001 seconds. It iterates over multiple timer runs to evaluate the timer's performance in terms of the minimum, maximum, and average time taken for each timing cycle.

Overall, the file serves as a testbed for assessing the behavior and accuracy of the threading-based timer functionality in Python, offering insights into the performance and execution characteristics of timers in a multithreaded environment.
