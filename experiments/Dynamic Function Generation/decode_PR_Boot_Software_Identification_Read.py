"""
This Python script provides an example of the various stages of the uds communication flow, serving as a demonstration of how an auto-coder would generate code for a system. The script outlines the different stages involved in UDS communication using diagnostic identifiers and response payloads.

Key Components:
1. check_Boot_Software_Identification_Read Function: This function validates the response payload for the Boot Software Identification Read operation. It checks the response length, response type (positive/negative), and diagnostic identifier match to ensure the integrity of the received data.

2. decode_Boot_Software_Identification_Read Function: This function decodes the response payload for the Boot Software Identification Read operation after passing the payload through the check function. It extracts specific fields like numberOfModules and Boot Software Identification, converting them into a structured result dictionary for further processing.

3. Test Validation and Execution: The script provides a test value for a correct response payload (testVal_correct) for the Boot Software Identification Read operation. It then executes the decode function on the test value to demonstrate the decoding process and prints the decoded response.

This exemplary code is intended solely for illustrative purposes and does not represent functional or deployable code.
