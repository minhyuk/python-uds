"""
This code file serves as an example illustrating the various stages of the UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) communication flow. It is primarily intended to demonstrate the auto-coder's generation of code for the system, and is not meant for practical usage.

The script showcases the following key components:

1. `check_Boot_Software_Identification_Read(payload)`:
   - The function template for checking the response payload from the diagnostic identifier 'Boot_Software_Identification_Read.'
   - Validates the response for length, response codes, and diagnostic identifier matching.
   - Raises exceptions for unexpected responses and identifies negative responses.

2. `decode_Boot_Software_Identification_Read(payload)`:
   - The corresponding function template for decoding the response payload and presenting the data to the user.
   - Utilizes the check function to validate the payload before decoding.
   - Populates dynamic fields such as 'numberOfModules' and 'Boot Software Identification.'

3. Test Data and Output:
   - The script provides 'testVal_correct' as sample response data for 'Boot_Software_Identification_Read.'
   - The decoded response is printed to showcase the decoded values for 'numberOfModules' and 'Boot Software Identification.'

Overall, this code demonstrates a structured approach for verifying and decoding responses in the context of UDS communication, providing insights into potential design considerations and functionality implementations.
