"""
This script serves as an experimental implementation and should not be used for any critical programming purposes. It demonstrates a set of functions related to reading data by identifier, including payload checking, response decoding, and user presentation. The script contains templates for checking and decoding the response payload, and sample data is used for testing the functions.

Key Components and Functionality:
- readDataByIdentifier(diagnosticIdentifier):
  - This function provides an example content of reading data by identifier using requests and responses dictionaries.
  - The payload is fetched from the readDataByIdentifier_requests dictionary.
  - A template uds request and response handling is showcased but currently commented out.
  - The decode function specified in readDataByIdentifier_responses dictionary is applied to the response before returning the result.

- check_rdbiPayload_template & decode_rdbiPayload_template:
  - These are function templates for checking the response payload and decoding it, respectively.
  - The templates use string formatting to dynamically generate functions for a specific diagnostic identifier (Boot_Software_Identification_Read).
  - The check function validates response length, response identifiers, and raises exceptions for unexpected responses.
  - The decode function processes the payload, populating fields dynamically as needed.

- Dynamic Code Execution:
  - The check_rdbiPayload_template and decode_rdbiPayload_template are executed to define the respective functions in the script dynamically.

- Sample Data and Test Output:
  - 'testVal_correct' holds sample response data for 'Boot_Software_Identification_Read'.
  - The 'decode_Boot_Software_Identification_Read' function is invoked with test data to demonstrate response decoding.

Overall, this script provides a demonstration of dynamic function generation, payload validation, and response decoding practices in Python, tailored for analyzing specific response formats related to diagnostic identifiers.
