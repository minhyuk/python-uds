"""
This Python script contains an experimental code that simulates a scenario where a request is made to read data by an identifier, and the responses are processed and decoded. The code includes functions to handle validation of the response payload and decoding of the response data based on the diagnostic identifier received.

The key components of the script are as follows:
1. readDataByIdentifier function: Simulates the process of reading data by an identifier. It retrieves the payload for a specific diagnostic identifier, sends the request (which is commented out for simulation purposes), receives the response (also commented out), and decodes the response using the corresponding decode function based on the diagnosticIdentifier input.

2. check_rdbiPayload_template: This template dynamically generates a function for checking the validity of the response payload. It validates the response length, response type, and diagnostic identifier match based on the expected values provided.

3. decode_rdbiPayload_template: This template dynamically generates a function for decoding the response payload based on a specific structure. It includes fields like numberOfModules and Boot_Software_Identification and converts the encoded payload into a readable format.

4. testVal_correct and decode function execution: The script includes a test value for a correct response payload, and it executes the decode function generated using the decode_rdbiPayload_template on the test value to demonstrate the decoding process.

Overall, the script showcases a structured approach to handling and processing responses in a simulated environment, demonstrating the separation of validation and decoding logic for handling responses effectively.
