"""
This script demonstrates the usage of the createUdsConnection function from the uds module to establish a UDS connection and retrieve the serial number of an ECU.

- The createUdsConnection function is utilized to create a Uds connection object 'a' from the "Diagnostics.odx-d" file.
- The request and response IDs are set to 0x7E0 and 0x7E8, respectively, with the interface specified as "peak" and the device named "PCAN_USBBUS1".
- The SerialNumber variable stores the result obtained by sending a request for the "ECU Serial Number" data identifier using the readDataByIdentifier method.
- The script then prints the decoded serial number, which, in the case of the E400, is expected to be "000000000098" or a similar value.

This script illustrates how to establish a UDS connection, retrieve specific information from an ECU, and work with the obtained data.
