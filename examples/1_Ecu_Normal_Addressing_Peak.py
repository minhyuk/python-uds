"""
Demonstrates the usage of the Uds class to send UDS requests and receive responses.

- An instance 'a' of the Uds class is created with specific parameter values (reqId, resId, interface, device).
- A standard Tester Present request ([0x3E, 0x00]) is sent using the 'a' object, and the response is stored in the TesterPresent variable.
- The response data of the standard Tester Present request is printed; for this test case, it should be [0x7E, 0x00].
- Another UDS request is sent to retrieve the ECU Serial Number ([0x22, 0xF1, 0x8C]), and the response is stored in the SerialNumber variable.
- The response from the ECU for the Serial Number request is printed; the output may vary depending on the ECU system, but it is anticipated to start with [0x6E, 0xF1, 0x8C].

This script showcases the utilization of the Uds class to send standard UDS requests and process the responses received from the ECU.
