This script defines a utility function 'fillArray' for padding out an array with a fill value. The script also defines the class TestTp implementing the interfaces from iTp for sending and receiving messages for a Test Transport Protocol. It contains methods for sending data and receiving data. The send and receive methods are implemented to raise exceptions because TestTp should not be used directly but should be mocked.
