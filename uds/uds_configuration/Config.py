"""
This script defines a class `Config` that extends the `ConfigParser` class from the standard library `configparser`. The class is used for parsing configuration files and is tailored for handling configuration data.

The script includes metadata information such as author, copyrights, license, maintainer, email, and status for identification and documentation purposes.

The `Config` class inherits from `ConfigParser` and initializes the class using the superclass `__init__` method. It provides a foundation for creating and managing configuration objects in Python applications, allowing for the parsing and retrieval of configuration data.

Note: The script serves as a basic configuration handler, leveraging the functionality of `ConfigParser` for reading and manipulating configuration files.
