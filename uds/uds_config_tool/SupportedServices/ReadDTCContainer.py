"""
This script defines the `ReadDTCContainer` class, which contains functions related to reading Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) in the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. The class includes methods for binding functions to an external object, adding request, check, negative response, and positive response functions related to the Read DTC service.

The class implements a static method named `__readDTC` that handles reading DTCs based on the provided subfunction, DTC status mask, DTC mask record, DTC snapshot record number, DTC extended record number, and DTC severity mask. It constructs the request by calling the appropriate request function, sends the request, receives the response, and validates it based on the expected responses and data provided. The method also includes checks for negative responses and processes positive responses accordingly.

Furthermore, the class provides methods to add various functions to the container, such as functions for handling requests, checks, negative responses, and positive responses related to reading DTCs. These methods allow for customizing the processing of data in the Read DTC service.

Overall, this class manages the operations related to reading Diagnostic Trouble Codes in the UDS protocol, ensuring requests are correctly formed, responses are validated, and appropriate actions are taken based on the response received.
