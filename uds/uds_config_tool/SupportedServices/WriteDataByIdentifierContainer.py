This script defines the `WriteDataByIdentifierContainer` class, which contains methods related to writing data in the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. The class includes functions for binding functions to an external UDS object and adding various functions for handling requests, checks, negative responses, and positive responses associated with the Write Data by Identifier service.

The class implements a static method named `__writeDataByIdentifier` that handles writing data based on the provided parameter and data record. The method constructs and sends the request, receives the response, and validates it with the corresponding check function. It also manages negative responses, processes positive responses, and returns the response accordingly.

Furthermore, the class provides methods to add different functions to the container, allowing for custom functions related to writing data by identifier. These methods offer flexibility in performing operations specific to the Write Data by Identifier service.

Overall, this class controls the operations for writing data in the UDS protocol, ensuring the handling of requests, responses, and validations to facilitate the process of writing data based on the provided parameter and data record.
