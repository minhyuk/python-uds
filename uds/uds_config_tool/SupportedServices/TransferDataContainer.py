This script defines the `TransferDataContainer` class, which contains functions related to transferring data in the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. The class includes methods for binding functions to an external object, adding request, check, negative response, and positive response functions related to the Transfer Data service.

The class implements a static method named `__transferData` that handles the transfer of data based on the provided block sequence counter, transfer request parameter record, and other transfer data attributes. It includes the ability to send chunks of data in a specified block or IHEx file using the defined `transferChunks` method. The method constructs and sends the request, receives the response, and validates it with the corresponding check function. Moreover, it can handle negative responses, process positive responses, and return the response accordingly.

Furthermore, the class provides methods to add various functions to the container, such as functions for handling requests, checks, negative responses, and positive responses related to data transfer. These methods offer the flexibility to customize the processing of data in the Transfer Data service.

Overall, this class manages the operations related to transferring data in the UDS protocol, allowing for sending chunks of data as well as verifying and processing responses during the data transfer process.
