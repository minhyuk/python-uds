"""
This code defines a `RequestUploadContainer` class that holds functions related to the RequestUpload service in Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. It includes methods for binding functions to an external Uds object, adding request, check, negative response, and positive response functions related to the RequestUpload service. It also includes a static method `__requestUpload` that handles the execution of the RequestUpload service request and responses. The functions related to each type of action (request, check, negative response, positive response) are stored and mapped to the RequestUpload service identifiers within the container.

Note: The functions and structure of this class are hardcoded for the RequestUpload service.
