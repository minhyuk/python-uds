"""
This module defines a `RequestUploadContainer` class that is used to manage request, check, negative response, and positive response functions for the RequestUpload service. It also includes a static method, `__requestUpload`, that executes the RequestUpload service request-response action. The `bind_function` method binds the `__requestUpload` method to an external Uds object, allowing it to be called as an in-built method to perform the RequestUpload service operation.

    checkFunctions: Dictionary to store check functions for the RequestUpload service.
    negativeResponseFunctions: Dictionary to store functions to handle negative responses for the RequestUpload service.
