This script defines the `ReadDataByIdentifierContainer` class, which contains functions related to the Read Data By Identifier service in the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. It includes methods for binding functions to an external object, adding request, check, negative response, and positive response functions related to the Read Data By Identifier service.

The class implements a static method named `__readDataByIdentifier` that handles reading data by identifiers (DIDs) from the ECU. It constructs the request by calling functions associated with SID (Service Identifier) and DID (Data Identifier), sends the request, receives the response, and validates the response data based on expected lengths and content. The method also includes checks for negative responses and processes positive responses accordingly.

Furthermore, the class provides methods to add various functions to the container, such as functions for handling SID, SID response length, DID responses, DID response length, negative responses, and positive responses. These methods enable the customization and addition of functions for processing data in the Read Data By Identifier service.

Overall, this class manages the operations related to reading data by identifiers in the UDS protocol, ensuring requests are correctly constructed, responses are validated, and appropriate actions are taken based on the responses received.
