This script defines an abstract base class `iContainer` using the `ABCMeta` metaclass from the `abc` module. The class serves as an interface for defining methods related to handling functions within a container, focusing on request functions, check functions, negative response functions, and positive response functions.

The class contains abstract methods that need to be implemented by any class that inherits from it. These methods include:
- `add_requestFunction`: Abstract method for adding a request function to the container.
- `add_checkFunction`: Abstract method for adding a check function to the container.
- `add_negativeResponseFunction`: Abstract method for adding a negative response function to the container.
- `add_positiveResponseFunction`: Abstract method for adding a positive response function to the container.

By defining these abstract methods, the `iContainer` class sets the structure for classes that will implement specific functionality related to request processing, response validation, and handling of requests and responses within a container.

Overall, this abstract class establishes a blueprint for classes that handle different aspects of processing functions within a container, ensuring consistency and structure in managing functions for UDS-related services.
