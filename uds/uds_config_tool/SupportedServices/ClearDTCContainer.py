"""
This script defines the `ClearDTCContainer` class, which contains functions related to the Clear Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) service in the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. It includes methods for binding functions to an external object, adding request, check, negative response, and positive response functions related to the Clear DTC service.

The class implements a static method named `__clearDTC` that handles clearing DTC actions. It creates a request to clear DTCs, sends the request, receives the response, and validates the response to ensure it is a positive one. The method handles negative responses and checks the data after clearing DTCs.

Overall, this class manages the operations related to clearing DTCs in the UDS protocol, providing a structured approach to executing clear DTC actions and validating responses.
