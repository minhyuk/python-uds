"""
This script defines the `SecurityAccessContainer` class, which contains functions related to the Security Access service in Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. It includes methods for binding functions to an external object, adding request, check, negative response, and positive response functions related to the Security Access service.

The class implements a static method named `__securityAccess` that handles security access actions. It checks the key format, sends a request for a key response if a key is provided, and processes the response to determine the output. The method ensures proper handling of negative responses and validates the data received.

Overall, this class manages the operations related to security access in the UDS protocol, providing a structured approach to executing security-related actions and validating responses.
