"""
This script defines the `InputOutputControlContainer` class, which contains functions related to the Input/Output Control service in the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. It includes methods for binding functions to an external object, adding request, check, negative response, and positive response functions related to the Input/Output Control service.

The class implements a static method named `__inputOutputControl` that handles input/output control actions. It creates a request to control input/output options, sends the request, receives the response, and validates the response to ensure it is a positive one. The method handles negative responses and checks the data after controlling the input/output.

Overall, this class manages the operations related to input/output control in the UDS protocol, providing a structured approach to executing input/output control actions and validating responses.
