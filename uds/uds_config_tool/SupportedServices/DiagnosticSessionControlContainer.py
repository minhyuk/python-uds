"""
This module defines a `DiagnosticSessionControlContainer` class that manages request, check, negative response, and positive response functions for the DiagnosticSessionControl service. It includes static methods to handle the DiagnosticSessionControl request-response action, tester present messages, and session timing. The `bind_function` method binds the methods to an external Uds object for use as in-built methods.

Attributes:
    __metaclass__: Metaclass for the `DiagnosticSessionControlContainer` class.
    requestFunctions: Dictionary to store request functions for the DiagnosticSessionControl service.
    checkFunctions: Dictionary to store check functions for the DiagnosticSessionControl service.
    negativeResponseFunctions: Dictionary to store functions to handle negative responses for the DiagnosticSessionControl service.
    positiveResponseFunctions: Dictionary to store functions to handle positive responses for the DiagnosticSessionControl service.
    testerPresent: Dictionary to store tester present session information.
    currentSession: Stores the current diagnostic session.
    lastSend: Timestamp of the last message sent in seconds.

Methods:
    - __diagnosticSessionControl: Static method to execute the DiagnosticSessionControl request-response action.
    - __testerPresentSessionRecord: Static method to provide information on tester present message requirements.
    - __sessionSetLastSend: Static method to record the last send time for the diagnostic session.
    - __testerPresentDisable: Static method to disable the tester present message for the current diagnostic session.
    - __sessionTimeSinceLastSend: Static method to calculate the time in seconds since the last message was sent.
    - bind_function: Binds the methods to an external Uds object.
    - add_requestFunction: Adds a request function to the DiagnosticSessionControlContainer.
    - add_checkFunction: Adds a check function to the DiagnosticSessionControlContainer.
    - add_negativeResponseFunction: Adds a function to handle negative responses to the DiagnosticSessionControlContainer.
    - add_positiveResponseFunction: Adds a function to handle positive responses to the DiagnosticSessionControlContainer.
