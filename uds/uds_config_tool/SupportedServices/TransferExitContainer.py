"""
This script defines the `TransferExitContainer` class, which contains functions related to transferring data in the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. The class includes methods for binding functions to an external object, adding request, check, negative response, and positive response functions related to the Transfer Exit service.

The class implements a static method named `__transferExit` that handles the transfer exit based on the provided transfer request parameter record. It constructs and sends the request, receives the response, and validates it with the corresponding check function. The method also processes negative responses and handles positive responses accordingly.

Furthermore, the class provides methods to add various functions to the container, such as functions for handling requests, checks, negative responses, and positive responses related to transfer exit. These methods allow for customizing the processing of data in the Transfer Exit service.

Overall, this class manages the operations related to data transfer termination in the UDS protocol, ensuring requests are correctly formed, responses are validated, and appropriate actions are taken based on the response received.
