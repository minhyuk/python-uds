"""
This script sets up UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) communication by parsing an XML file with different services and functions, allowing for interactions with an ECU (Electronic Control Unit).

Functions:
- get_serviceIdFromXmlElement(diagServiceElement, xmlElements): Retrieves the service ID from an XML element.
- fill_dictionary(xmlElement): Creates a dictionary from an XML element.
- createUdsConnection(xmlFile, ecuName, ihexFile=None, **kwargs): Creates a UDS connection based on the configuration in the XML file and additional parameters.

The script initializes UDS services like DiagnosticSessionControl, ECUReset, ReadDataByIdentifier, WriteDataByIdentifier, ClearDiagnosticInformation, and more.
Each service includes methods for handling request, response, and other service-specific operations.

Example Usage:
- Create a UDS connection using an XML configuration file and an ECU name.
- Interact with various services such as DiagnosticSessionControl, ECUReset, ReadDataByIdentifier, WriteDataByIdentifier, ClearDiagnosticInformation, and more.
