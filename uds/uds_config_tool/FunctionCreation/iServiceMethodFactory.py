"""
The script defines an abstract service method factory class, `IServiceMethodFactory`, that serves as a blueprint for creating different types of service method factories in the project. It contains abstract methods for creating request functions, checking positive responses, encoding positive responses, and creating negative response functions for a given service element. These abstract methods provide a guideline for implementing service-specific factories by defining the required functionality each factory should support. Any class that inherits from `IServiceMethodFactory` must implement these abstract methods to define the behavior of the service method factory for a particular service element.
