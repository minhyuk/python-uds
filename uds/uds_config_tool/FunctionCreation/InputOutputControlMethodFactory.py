"""
The script defines a factory class, `InputOutputControlMethodFactory`, that generates methods to create request functions, check positive responses, encode positive responses, and create negative response functions for a service element named InputOutputControlMethodFactory. The methods in this factory dynamically generate functions based on the service element's attributes and ODX XML data. It provides a flexible and automated way to handle various aspects of the InputOutputControlMethodFactory service in the project. The factory relies on predefined templates to generate these functions for different types of service elements efficiently. The methods in this factory are static and responsible for creating different aspects of handling the InputOutputControlMethodFactory service.
