The script defines a factory class, `WriteDataByIdentifierMethodFactory`, responsible for creating methods related to writing data by identifier operations in a diagnostic service. These methods handle tasks such as creating request functions, checking positive responses for validity, encoding positive responses, and creating negative response functions. The factory class ensures that the service element has the required methods implemented based on specified templates and guidelines. It manages interactions related to write data by identifier operations and handles responses according to the expected format and parameters outlined in the script.
