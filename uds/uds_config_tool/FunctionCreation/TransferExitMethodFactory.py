This script defines a class `TransferExitMethodFactory` responsible for creating request functions, checking positive responses, encoding positive responses, and checking negative responses for a specific diagnostic service element related to transfer exits in a Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) configuration tool. The script contains templates for request functions, check functions, and response encoding based on program parameters such as parameter records.

The script includes metadata information such as author, copyrights, license, maintainer, email, and status for identification and documentation purposes.

The `TransferExitMethodFactory` class contains static methods that handle the creation of request functions, checking positive responses for validity, encoding positive responses, and creating negative response functions specific to transfer exit services. The script is designed to handle various service attributes and response details based on the ODX information.

Note: The script is tailored to handle transfer exit services, ensuring the responses are validated and processed correctly, with additional checks for negative responses in case of errors.
