"""
This script defines a factory class, `ClearDTCMethodFactory`, that generates methods to create request functions, check positive responses, encode positive responses, and create negative response functions for a service element named ClearDTCMethodFactory. The methods in this factory dynamically generate functions based on the service element's attributes and ODX XML data. It provides a flexible and automated way to handle various aspects of the ClearDTCMethodFactory service in the project. The factory relies on predefined templates to generate these functions for each type of service element efficiently. The methods in this factory are static and responsible for creating different aspects of handling the ClearDTCMethodFactory service.
