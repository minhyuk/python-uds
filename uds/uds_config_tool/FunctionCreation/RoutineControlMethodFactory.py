"""
This script defines a class `RoutineControlMethodFactory` that handles the creation of request functions, positive response checker functions, encoding of positive responses, and negative response functions for a specific diagnostic service element related to routine control in a Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) configuration tool. The script includes templates for request functions, check functions, and response encoding based on different parameters such as service IDs, control types, and routine IDs.

The script utilizes metadata information such as author, copyrights, license, maintainer, email, and status for identification and documentation purposes.

The `RoutineControlMethodFactory` class contains static methods for creating request functions, checking positive responses, encoding positive responses, and checking negative responses for a specific diagnostic service element focused on routine control. The script is designed to handle various control types, suppression of responses, and response encoding based on the ODX information.

Note: The script is specifically tailored for routine control services, ensuring that the response is handled appropriately and avoiding duplication in cases of send-only service versions with the same short name.
