"""
This script defines a class `ReadDTCMethodFactory` that handles the creation of request functions, positive response checker functions, encoding of positive responses, and negative response functions for a specific diagnostic service element in a Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) configuration tool. The script includes various templates for request functions, check functions, and response encoding based on different service IDs and subfunctions. It is set up for parsing and creating functions related to reading Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC).

The script utilizes metadata information such as author, copyrights, license, maintainer, email, and status for identification and documentation purposes.

The `ReadDTCMethodFactory` class contains static methods for creating request functions, checking positive responses, encoding positive responses, and checking negative responses for a specific diagnostic service element. The methods handle various subfunctions and response types associated with reading DTC information. The script includes templates for request and check functions, encoding responses, and handling negative responses.

Note: The script is focused on parsing diagnostic data and creating functions specific to reading DTC, with some parts manually configured due to the complexity of handling this type of information.
