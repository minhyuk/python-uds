"""
This script defines a factory class, `ECUResetMethodFactory`, that generates methods to create request functions, check positive responses, encode positive responses, and create negative response functions for a service element. The methods in this factory dynamically generate functions based on the service element's attributes and ODX XML data. It provides a flexible and automated way to handle various service elements' request and response logic in the project. The factory relies on predefined templates to generate these functions for each type of service element efficiently.
