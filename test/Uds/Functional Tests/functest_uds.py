"""
This script includes functions and a main block to simulate UDS communication scenarios using virtual CAN buses. It defines several functions such as clearReceiveBuffer, getNextReceivedMessage, onReceiveCallback, singleFrameResponse_target, and multiFrameResponse_target to handle message reception and response. The main block sets up a virtual bus, a listener, and an Uds connection. It creates threads for testing single and multi-frame responses for UDS requests, simulates message sending and receiving, and prints the test results.
