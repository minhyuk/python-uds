This code sets up a virtual bus and a listener for receiving messages. It defines a callback function callback_onReceive to process incoming messages based on their arbitration ID. Within the main block, it creates an instance of the Uds class and sends a specific UDS request. After sending the request, the program waits for 2 seconds before exiting.
