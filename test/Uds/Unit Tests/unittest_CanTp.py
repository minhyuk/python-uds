"""
This script contains a series of test cases within the CanTpTestCase class to test various functionalities of the CanTp class for handling segmentation and reassembly of CAN messages. Each test method is annotated with specific scenarios and expectations, such as sending single and multiple frames, handling different block sizes, and ensuring correct block creation and processing. The unittest module is used in combination with mock functions to simulate CAN bus interactions and verify the behavior of the CanTp class under different conditions.
