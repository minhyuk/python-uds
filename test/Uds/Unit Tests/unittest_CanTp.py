"""
The provided code defines a test case class CanTpTestCase which contains multiple test methods for testing the behavior of the
CanTp class used for the CAN Transport Protocol. The tests cover various scenarios including handling exceptions for large
payloads, sending single-frame messages, sending small multi-frame messages, sending larger multi-frame messages, and creating
block lists for different block sizes and numbers of Protocol Data Units (PDUs). The test methods utilize patching for mocking
specific functions and bus send operations.

By executing these tests with various input scenarios, the functionality and correctness of the CanTp class handling different
types of data frames and responses are validated. Additionally, the test_canTpCreateBlock_noBlockSizePdu test method covers
extensive block list creation without defined block sizes, demonstrating the flexibility and robustness of the CanTp class.

The unittest.main() function triggers the test execution when the script is run as the main program.
