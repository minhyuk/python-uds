"""
The script defines a test case class CanTpMessageTestCase for testing the behavior and functionality of the ResettableTimer class.
The test case includes multiple test methods that cover various scenarios related to the timer's states, transitions, and accuracy.

Each test method validates a specific aspect of the ResettableTimer class by setting up the timer, performing actions such as starting,
stopping, restarting, and checking the timer state in different conditions. The test cases check for correct behavior when the timer
expires, stops, or resets.

The individual test methods are as follows:
- testStateWhenInitialised: Tests the initial state of the timer after initialization.
- testStateAfterStart: Tests the state after starting the timer.
- testStateAfterTimeoutTime: Tests the state after the timer expires.
- testStateAfterRestart: Tests the state after restarting the timer.
- testStateAfterRestartAndExpiry: Tests the state after restarting and allowing the timer to expire.
- testStateAfterExpiredThenRestart: Tests the state after the timer expires and is restarted.
- testStopAfterStart: Tests the state after stopping the timer.
- testIsExpiredWith0Time: Tests the timer's behavior with a timeout value of 0.
- testTimerAccuracy: Tests the accuracy of the timer by measuring the elapsed time.

The script finishes by executing the tests using unittest.main(), which runs all the test methods defined in the CanTpMessageTestCase
class and verifies the expected outcomes against the actual results.
