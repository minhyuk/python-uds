"""
This module contains a set of test cases within the CanTpMessageTestCase class to validate the functionality of the ResettableTimer class. Each test method evaluates different aspects of the timer behavior, such as its initial state, starting, resetting, expiring, stopping, and accuracy in terms of timing. The unittest framework is utilized to run and assert the expected outcomes of these tests, helping ensure the correct performance of the ResettableTimer class under various scenarios.
