"""
This script includes a set of test cases within the UdsTestCase class to verify the functionality of the Uds class for sending UDS requests using different configurations. Three test methods are defined to cover sending UDS requests with and without responses, as well as functional requests. Mocking is applied to simulate the test environment by patching the 'uds.TestTp.send' method. Each test method sets up the necessary conditions and asserts the expected results after calling the corresponding Uds methods. The unittest framework is utilized to run the tests and validate the behavior of the Uds class in the specified scenarios.
