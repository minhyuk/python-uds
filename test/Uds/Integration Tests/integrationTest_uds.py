"""
This script contains a single test case within the UdsTestCase class to validate the Uds class functionality for sending UDS requests with responses. The test_udsSendWithResponse method is patched to simulate the behavior of 'uds.TestTp.send' and 'uds.TestTp.recv' methods using mock objects. It sets up the expected responses and verifies that the Uds connection properly sends the specified UDS request and receives the correct response data. The unittest framework is utilized to run this test and confirm the interaction between the Uds class and the TestTp transport protocol.
