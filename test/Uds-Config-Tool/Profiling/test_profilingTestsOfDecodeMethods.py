"""
The script performs profiling on functions related to converting lists of integers to integers (buildIntFromList) and lists of integers
to strings (byteListToString). It demonstrates three implementations of each conversion method: non-recursive, recursive, and using the reduce
function.

The code includes the following key sections:
1. Profiler Code:
    - The do_cprofile function is utilized as a decorator to perform cProfile-based profiling of specified functions.

2. buildIntFromList Tests:
    - Three versions of the buildIntFromList function are implemented: non-recursive, recursive, and using the reduce function.
    - Each version converts a list of integers to a single integer by considering byte values.

3. byteListToString Tests:
    - Similar to buildIntFromList, three functions are implemented for converting a list of integers to a concatenated string of characters.
    - The implementations include non-recursive, recursive, and reduce-based methods.

4. Main Execution:
    - The script sets the recursion limit to handle larger datasets.
    - Test lists testListA and testListB are created with 2500 elements of 0x5a and 0x30, respectively, for testing the conversion methods.
    - Various test cases are performed utilizing all versions of buildIntFromList and byteListToString implementations.
    - The script compares the results from different implementations to ensure consistency and correctness.

The script showcases different techniques for converting lists of integers to integers and strings, and provides a mechanism to profile the
performance of each implementation using cProfile. Additionally, it verifies the equality of results between different conversion methods to
validate their correctness.
