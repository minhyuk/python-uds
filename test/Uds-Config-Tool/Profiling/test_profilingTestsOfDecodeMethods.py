"""
This script contains functions to test three different approaches of converting a list of bytes to an integer and a list of bytes to a string. The functions utilize non-recursive, recursive, and reduce approaches to perform the conversions. Additionally, the script includes a profiler decorator function to analyze the performance of these conversion methods. The main block of the script sets up test data, performs tests on the conversion functions, and asserts that the results are consistent across the different conversion methods.
