"""
The script contains a set of test cases designed to assess the transferExit functionality within the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. The tests focus on validating the termination of data transfer operations using the UDS communication interface by simulating positive and negative response scenarios.

Each test method is configured to leverage mock objects for the CanTp send and receive functions, ensuring controlled testing environments for the transferExit operation. By generating specific response values, the tests evaluate the system's handling of transfer completion signals and verify the appropriate termination of data transfer sessions.

Key Features:
- The test suite includes scenarios to confirm the successful completion of data transfer processes and the reception of acknowledgment signals.
- Negative response tests simulate error conditions to evaluate the system's behavior when encountering faulty or invalid responses during the termination of data transfer.

Test Methods:
1. The 'test_transExitRequest' method evaluates the successful termination of a data transfer session by initiating a transferExit operation with a specified block sequence and parameter record.
2. Additional test methods assess the system's response to negative scenarios, such as encountering error codes '0x13', '0x22', and '0x24' during the transferExit process, ensuring proper exception handling and error detection mechanisms.

Note: The code includes commented-out test methods reserved for alternative test scenarios, providing reference implementations that are not currently active within the test suite.
Please refer to the individual test method docstrings and comments within the script for specific details on each test case and their evaluation of the transferExit operation.
