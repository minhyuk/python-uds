"""
The script consists of a test suite to validate the process of exiting a data transfer operation within the Unified Diagnostic Service (UDS) protocol implementation, specifically focusing on invoking the transferExit function in a UDS connection.

Key Features:
1. Definitions and Setup:
    - Contains author information, licensing details, and necessary imports for executing test cases related to ending data transfer in the UDS protocol.

2. Test Cases:
    - Defines test cases to verify the behavior of the transferExit function in a UDS connection, simulating responses to the transfer exit action with mock objects for CanTp communication.

3. Testing Transfer Exit:
    - The test suite examines the functionality of ending a data transfer operation within the UDS protocol by calling the transferExit method with specified parameters.
    - Assertions are made to compare the expected responses and recorded interactions (like sending certain data) during the transfer exit process.

4. Handling Negative Responses:
    - Some test cases evaluate scenarios where negative UDS responses (e.g., 0x13, 0x22, 0x24) are received during the transfer exit operation.
    - Error handling mechanisms are tested by checking if exceptions are raised appropriately in response to negative scenarios.

Overall, the script focuses on testing the graceful exit of data transfer operations within the UDS protocol implementation, covering different response codes and ensuring proper handling of exceptions during the transfer exit process.
