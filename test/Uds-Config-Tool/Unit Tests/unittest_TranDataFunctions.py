"""
This script defines a series of test cases for evaluating the data transfer operations within the UDS protocol, specifically focusing on the transferData functionality. The test suite verifies the transfer of Intel HEX formatted files using the UDS communication interface, testing both positive and negative response scenarios.

The test methods leverage mock objects to simulate the CanTp send and receive functions, ensuring controlled testing environments for the data transfer operations. Additionally, the test cases examine error handling mechanisms by verifying the response to negative service requests, such as invalid block sequences or parameter records.

Notable Features:
- Test scenarios involve various data transfer setups, both with standard block sequences and specific parameter records.
- Negative response tests cover situations where the transfer operation encounters errors, providing insight into the fault diagnosis and exception handling capabilities.

Test Methods:
1. The 'test_transDataRequest_ihex' method evaluates the transferFile operation with an Intel HEX file and blockSequenceCounter validation.
2. Additional test methods explore different transferData scenarios with specific block sequences and parameter records to ensure the functionality's robustness and compliance with UDS specifications.

Note: The code includes commented-out test methods that are retained for reference but not executed due to architectural changes in the UDS module.

Please refer to the individual test method docstrings and comments within the script for detailed information on each test case and its specific data transfer operation under examination.
