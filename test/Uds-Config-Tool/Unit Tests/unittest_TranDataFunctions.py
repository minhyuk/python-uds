"""
The script contains a test suite with multiple unit test cases to evaluate the data transfer operations in the Unified Diagnostic Service (UDS) protocol implementation, specifically focusing on transferring data while testing for various responses and scenarios.

Key Features:
1. Definitions and Imports:
    - Includes author information, licensing details, and various imports necessary for executing data transfer test cases in the UDS protocol.

2. Test Cases:
    - The script defines test cases to validate the transfer of data using UDS commands with different parameters and scenarios.
    - Mock objects are used for CanTp communication handling to simulate sending and receiving data during the tests efficiently.

3. Testing Data Transfer:
    - The test cases cover scenarios like transferring IHex files, handling negative responses, and evaluating block sequence counters and parameter records.
    - Detailed assertions are made to ensure the sent data and received responses align with the expected UDS communication protocol behavior.

4. Test Execution:
    - The test suite examines various data transfer scenarios using UDS commands and checks for error responses like values 0x13, 0x24, 0x31, 0x71, 0x72, 0x73, 0x92, and 0x93.
    - The tests verify the functionality of transferring data blocks efficiently and handling exceptions accurately in response to negative scenarios.

Overall, the script focuses on quality assurance of data transfer operations by testing different parameters, responses, and data block transmissions within the UDS protocol implementation.
