"""
The script encompasses a test suite designed to verify the behavior of the ECU Reset function within the UDS protocol. The test cases are focused on testing various aspects of the ECU Reset functionality, including different request configurations, handling of negative responses, and the impact of response suppression on the reset operation.

Key Elements:
1. Authorship and Documentation:
    - Provides information about the author and essential details related to copyrights, licensing, and contact details.

2. Test Setup and Dependencies:
    - The script imports the required modules, sets up the test environment, and establishes connectivity to the UDS module for executing the test cases.

3. ECU Reset Test Cases:
    - Contains test cases to evaluate distinct scenarios of ECU reset requests, response handling, and error management within the UDS framework.

4. Validation and Assertions:
    - Utilizes assertions to confirm the expected outcomes of the ECU reset requests, ensuring proper functioning and accurate responses from the UDS module.

5. ECU Reset Negative Response Handling:
    - Incorporates test cases to simulate and handle negative responses during ECU reset requests, capturing exceptions and relevant error messages for validation.

6. Response Suppression Testing:
    - Includes tests to assess the impact of suppressing responses during the ECU reset operation, examining the response outcomes and expected behavior.

The test suite meticulously evaluates the effectiveness and accuracy of the ECU Reset feature within the UDS protocol, checking response handling, configuration options, and error detection to maintain reliable control over ECU reset operations.
