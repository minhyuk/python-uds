"""
This script defines a test suite to test the security access functions related to the Read Data By Identifier (RDBI) operation in the UDS protocol. It contains test cases for requesting security access keys, handling negative responses, and verifying access using keys.

Each test method is annotated with mock patches for sending and receiving messages in the UDS protocol. The tests evaluate the functionality of security access operations in the context of UDS communication.

Test Cases:
1. `test_securityAccessKeyRequest`: Tests requesting a security access key with a valid response.
2. `test_securityAccessNegativeResponse`: Tests handling a negative response during security access request.
3. `test_securityAccessKeyRequest`: Tests sending a security access key request with a valid response.

Note: The test suite focuses on verifying the security access functionality for UDS communication, ensuring the correct handling of security keys and responses.
