"""
This script defines a series of test cases for verifying the Input-Output Control operations in the UDS protocol. The test suite primarily focuses on the 'clearDTC' function that simulates the DTC clearing process with specific DTC identifiers.

The test methods are designed to patch the sending and receiving messages for the TestTp communication layer, allowing the testing of input-output control functionalities and response handling for various scenarios, including both positive and negative responses.

Notable Features:
- Test cases cover the 'clearDTC' operation with different input arguments to ensure proper functioning.
- Negative response scenarios such as 0x13, 0x22, and 0x31 are tested to verify the error handling mechanism within the 'clearDTC' functionality.

Test Methods:
1. The 'test_ioControlRequest_adjust' method evaluates the clearDTC functionality with specific DTC identification for adjustment.
2. Additional test methods focus on handling negative responses like 0x13, 0x22, and 0x31 during the execution of the 'clearDTC' operation, providing exception messages when negative responses are detected.

Please refer to the individual test method docstrings and comments within the script for detailed information on each test case and the specific input-output control operation being examined.
