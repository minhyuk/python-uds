"""
The script contains a series of test cases to evaluate the functionality of the writeDataByIdentifier operation in the context of the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. The tests are designed to verify the ability of the system to write and update specified data identifiers within electronic control units (ECUs), using the provided test environment and predefined responses.

Each test method utilizes the unittest framework along with mock objects for TestTp send and receive functions to simulate controlled interactions with the UDS system. By defining the expected behavior and response values, the script aims to validate the correctness of the writeDataByIdentifier function and its handling of diverse data input scenarios.

Highlighted Features:
- The test suite focuses on the assessment of the writeDataByIdentifier operation, specifically targeting the update of ECU serial numbers and boot software identification across different test cases.
- Various test methods evaluate the system's response to writing data identifiers in different formats, including ASCII and mixed data payloads, ensuring the correct translation and transmission within the UDS communication flow.

Test Methods Overview:
1. The 'test_wdbiAsciiRequest' method evaluates the system's writeDataByIdentifier function for updating ECU serial numbers with ASCII data inputs, verifying the transmission and encoding of the provided data.
2. Additional tests cover scenarios involving mixed data payloads, such as updating boot software identification with a combination of numerical and string values, assessing the system's handling of complex data structures during write operations.
3. Negative response tests simulate error conditions, testing the system's exception handling mechanisms for detecting and responding to erroneous UDS interactions, including specific negative response codes.

Note: Refer to the individual test method docstrings and comments in the script for detailed insights into each test case's evaluation of the writeDataByIdentifier feature and its compliance with the UDS protocol standards.
