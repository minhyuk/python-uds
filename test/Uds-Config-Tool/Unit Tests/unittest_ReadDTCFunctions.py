"""
This script contains a test suite for verifying the Read Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) functionality in the UDS protocol, specifically focusing on the 'readDTC' function with various sub-functions. This suite aims to test different scenarios related to reading DTC information, including retrieving DTCs by different status masks, severity masks, and other criteria.

The test cases perform mock patching for sending and receiving messages to simulate the UDS communication. Test methods have been defined for each sub-function supported by 'readDTC', along with the expected responses for positive and negative scenarios. 

Notable Sub-Functions Covered:
- reportDTCByStatusMask
- reportSupportedDTC
- reportNumberOfDTCByStatusMask

Important Note:
The script includes test cases for several sub-functions that are not currently supported by the test ODX file, indicating that those tests have not been run yet. It also mentions the requirement for adding tests involving ODX parsing to determine response structure for certain DTCs, as specified in the specification (tables 253 to 255).

Test Cases:
1. The 'test_readDTC_reportDTCByStatusMask' method tests the reportDTCByStatusMask sub-function.
2. The 'test_readDTC_reportSupportedDTC' method verifies the reportSupportedDTC sub-function.
3. Other test methods are defined for different sub-functions but note that tests for unsupported sub-functions have not been executed.

Negative Response Tests:
- The script includes tests for handling negative responses like 0x12, 0x13, and 0x31 during the readDTC operation, providing exception reporting for detected negative responses.

Please refer to the method docstrings and comments within the script for more specific details related to each test case and its respective sub-function.
