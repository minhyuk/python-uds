"""
The script includes a series of unit test cases to verify the functionality of the 'requestUpload' operation in the UDS protocol implementation.

Key Features:

1. Definitions and Imports:
    - Definitions of authorship, licensing, and credits.
    - Import statement for necessary modules and functions to perform unit testing on the 'requestUpload' function.

2. Test Cases:
    a. test_reqUploadRequest:
        - Tests the request for uploading data following a specific format and memory address.
    
    b. test_reqUploadRequest02:
        - Validates the functionality of requesting data upload with specific input parameters.

    c. test_reqUploadNegResponse_0x13:
        - Tests the handling of a negative response ('0x13') during data upload request.
    
    d. test_wdbiNegResponse_0x31:
        - Validates the behavior when a negative response ('0x31') is received during the data upload request.

    e. test_wdbiNegResponse_0x33:
        - Tests the handling of a negative response ('0x33') during the data upload request.

    f. test_wdbiNegResponse_0x70:
        - Validates the response to a negative response ('0x70') during the data upload request.

3. Testing Procedure:
    - Utilizes mock.patch to simulate the behavior of the Can Transport Protocol (CanTp).
    - Verifies the correct behavior in different upload request scenarios such as successful upload, negative responses, and exceptions handling.
    - Asserts the expected call arguments and responses during the requestUpload operation for varying conditions.

Note: The tests are primarily designed to assess the UDS protocol's upload operation; however, they are noted as currently non-functional due to missing service support in the provided ODX file. Regression tests for other UDS operations are run instead to ensure system stability.

4. Execution:
    - Executes the defined unit test cases using the unittest module for functional verification.
    - Utilizes mock objects to simulate communication with the Can Transport Protocol for testing different upload request scenarios.

Overall, the script aims to validate the correctness of the upload functionality within the UDS protocol, including addressing various response scenarios and ensuring proper exception handling mechanisms.
