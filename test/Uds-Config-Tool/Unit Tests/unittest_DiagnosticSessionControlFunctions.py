"""
The script comprises a series of test cases intended to assess the diagnosticSessionControl functionality within the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. These tests focus on validating the control and management of diagnostic sessions on electronic control units (ECUs) through the UDS communication interface.

Each test method is configured to utilize mock objects for the CanTp send and receive functions, ensuring controlled test environments for diagnostic session control operations. By defining specific response values, the tests evaluate the system's handling of session control commands and confirm the expected behavior of switching between diagnostic sessions.

Key Features:
- The test suite includes scenarios to verify the successful initiation of default, programming, and extended diagnostic sessions by triggering the diagnosticSessionControl operation with corresponding session types.
- Additional tests assess the system's response to negative scenarios, such as encountering error codes '0x12', '0x13', and '0x22' during diagnostic session control, ensuring proper error detection and exception handling mechanisms.

Test Methods:
1. The 'test_diagSessCtrlRequestDfltNoSuppress' method evaluates the initiation of a default diagnostic session without suppressing the response, examining session parameter records along with type information.
2. Furthermore, test methods validate the system's behavior when transitioning into different diagnostic sessions, including programming and extended diagnostic sessions based on defined session types.
3. Negative response tests simulate error conditions to evaluate exception handling mechanisms when encountering specific error codes during diagnostic session control operations.

Note: The commented-out test methods in the code provide reference implementations for additional scenarios that are not currently active within the test suite. Consult the individual test method docstrings and comments within the script for detailed information on each test case and its assessment of diagnostic session control functionalities.
