"""
The script presents a set of test cases designed to evaluate the inputOutputControl functionality of the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. These tests focus on examining the control and manipulation of input and output signals in electronic control units (ECUs) through the UDS communication mechanism.

Each test method is structured to utilize mock objects for the TestTp send and receive functions, thereby enabling controlled environments for inputOutputControl operations. By defining specific response values in the tests, the script assesses the system's ability to manage and adjust various input and output parameters as part of its diagnostic functionalities.

Key Highlights:
- The test suite covers scenarios to verify the initiation of inputOutputControl operations, including adjusting booster target speed and examining control options.
- Detailed tests evaluate the system's behavior in response to different control actions, such as adjusting target speed and executing return control within the inputOutputControl operation.

Test Methods Overview:
1. The 'test_ioControlRequest_adjust' method assesses the system's inputOutputControl feature by adjusting the booster target speed and verifying control options with defined target speed values.
2. Additional test methods confirm the proper handling of inputOutputControl commands in different scenarios, including returning control options and adjusting booster target speed in response to specific test conditions.
3. Negative response tests simulate error scenarios to evaluate the system's handling of negative responses and ensure the appropriate exception handling mechanisms are in place.

Note: The commented-out test methods in the code reference additional scenarios that are currently inactive within the test suite. Refer to individual test method docstrings and script comments for detailed insights into each test case's evaluation of inputOutputControl functionalities.
