"""
This script constitutes a unit test suite that evaluates the functionality of the Request Download operation within a Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) configuration tool. The tests focus on validating the Request Download procedure by sending requests and examining the responses to ensure the correct interaction between the diagnostic tool and the Electronic Control Unit (ECU).

The test cases, implemented using the unittest framework, verify various aspects of the Request Download operation, including the formatting and transmission of the download request, processing of the request parameters like Format Identifier, Memory Address, and Memory Size, as well as handling of responses associated with the download process.

Key Features:
- Request Download Operation Tests: Validate the behavior of the request download feature, covering scenarios with different parameter configurations to assess the flexibility and reliability of the download functionality.
- Response Handling Verification: Evaluate the tool's response to various types of replies from the ECU, such as positive acknowledgments and negative responses, ensuring appropriate feedback and error detection during the download process.
- Exception Cases Testing: Test the script's performance under exceptional conditions, like encountering negative responses (error codes) from the ECU, and verifying the correct exception handling mechanism.

Functionalities Explored:
1. Request Download Request Tests: Verify the creation and transmission of Request Download requests with different sets of parameters to accommodate various download requirements.
2. Response Handling Scenarios: Test the script's reaction to different response codes received from the ECU post the download request, ensuring proper processing and error reporting mechanisms.
3. Error Handling and Exception Tests: Evaluate the tool's ability to detect and handle errors, such as negative responses indicating download failures, confirming the robustness of the diagnostic tool in identifying and managing issues during communication.

Each unit test captures a specific download scenario to cover the complete range of functionalities offered by the Request Download feature in the UDS configuration tool, aiming to ensure the reliability and correctness of the download operation in different situations and conditions.
