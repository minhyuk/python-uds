"""
The script defines a series of test cases to evaluate the Request Download functionality in the UDS (Unified Diagnostic Service) protocol. These test cases focus on verifying the behavior of the request download operation by testing different request configurations, handling of negative responses, and exception scenarios.

Key Components and Functionality:
1. Authorship and Documentation:
    - Includes metadata such as author information, copyrights, and project details.

2. Test Suite for Request Download:
    - Test cases to validate the Request Download feature under various conditions.

3. Test Case - reqDownloadRequest:
    - Tests the request download operation with specific memory address and size parameters.
    - Verifies the CanTp send and receive calls, along with the response validation.

4. Test Case - reqDownloadRequest02:
    - Tests another instance of a request download operation with different memory configurations.
    - Asserts the correctness of the CanTp communication and the response data verification.

5. Test Case - reqDownloadNegResponse_0x13:
    - Simulates and handles negative response '0x13' during the request download process.
    - Evaluates the exception handling mechanism and response validation.

6. Test Case - wdbiNegResponse_0x22, wdbiNegResponse_0x31, wdbiNegResponse_0x33, wdbiNegResponse_0x72:
    - Covers additional negative response scenarios during the request download.
    - Checks the proper exception reporting and response interpretation under error conditions.

7. General Test Flow:
    - Establishes the required dependencies and sets up the test environment.
    - Contains the various test scenarios to ensure the accurate functioning of the Request Download functionality within the UDS implementation.

Overall, the test suite aims to thoroughly assess the Request Download operation, including its request formats, error handling, and adherence to protocol specifications when interacting with the UDS module."
