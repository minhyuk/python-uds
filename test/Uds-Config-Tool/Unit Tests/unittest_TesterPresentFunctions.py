"""
The script contains a test suite designed to validate the behavior of the UDS protocol's Tester Present functionality and associated diagnostic sessions. The test cases focus on confirming the handling of Tester Present messages, session switching, and tester present disabling/enabling operations within the UDS framework.

Key Elements:
1. Authorship and Documentation:
    - Information about the author and vital details regarding copyrights, licensing, and contact information.

2. Test Setup and Dependencies:
    - The script imports the necessary modules, sets up the testing environment, and establishes the connection to the UDS module for executing the test cases.

3. Tester Present Test Cases:
    - The test cases evaluate various scenarios related to the Tester Present feature, including default behavior, response suppression, negative response handling, and switching between diagnostic sessions with tester present checking.

4. Validation and Assertions:
    - The assertions verify the expected outcomes of the Tester Present functionality, session records, and time evaluation since the last message send, ensuring the correct operation of the UDS module.

5. Tester Present Session Handling:
    - Test cases validate the behavior of tester present session management, toggling between required and disabled states based on session configurations and the respective timeout values.

6. Time Evaluation and Manual Testing:
    - The script includes checks to evaluate the timing aspects, time since the last message send, and manual testing setups for verifying automated testerPresent sending.

The test suite rigorously assesses and confirms the accurate functionality of the Tester Present feature within the UDS protocol, focusing on session management, response handling, and time-sensitive operations to maintain robust communication control mechanisms.
