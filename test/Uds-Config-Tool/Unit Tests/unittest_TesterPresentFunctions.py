"""
This script serves as a test suite to validate the functionality of various methods related to the "Tester Present" feature implemented in the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) configuration tool. The test cases focus on verifying the behavior of the "Tester Present" functions, which facilitate communication between the diagnostic tool and the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for diagnostic testing and rapid verification.

Through a series of unit tests defined within the unittest framework, the script evaluates the performance and correctness of the tester present functionality across different scenarios and configurations. Each test case examines specific aspects of the "Tester Present" mechanism, aiming to ensure proper handling of communication requests and responses between the tester tool and the ECU under various conditions.

Key Features:
- Test cases cover multiple scenarios related to establishing tester presence in communication sessions, including default settings, response suppression, and timeout values for tester present signals.
- The script assesses the communication behavior when enabling or disabling the "Tester Present" feature, as well as the associated timeout management for maintaining the tester presence signal during diagnostic interactions.
- Tests provide insights into the performance of the session switchover process, verifying the configuration changes when transitioning between default and non-default diagnostic sessions with tester presence requirements.
- Evaluation of time-related functions confirms the accuracy of session timeouts and time elapsed since the last communication message, ensuring proper time tracking and management during diagnostic sessions.

Test Methods Overview:
1. Tester Present Request Tests: Validate the correct transmission of tester present signals and responses, assessing behavior with and without response suppression.
2. Negative Response Handling Tests: Verify the appropriate error handling when negative responses are detected, ensuring the script reacts accurately to diagnostic errors in communication.
3. Tester Presence Session Switching Test: Evaluate the tester present configurations during session changes, confirming proper behavior for enabling and disabling tester presence signals.
4. Time-Related Function Tests: Assess the accuracy of timeout values and time tracking mechanisms for tester present signals, verifying the correct timing behavior in diagnostic sessions.

Each test method encapsulates specific test scenarios and assertions to validate the functionality of the "Tester Present" feature, providing detailed assessments of the script's performance in managing tester presence signals during diagnostic communication sessions.
