"""
This script defines a test suite for testing the functions related to reading diagnostic identifiers (DIDs) using the UDS protocol. It includes test cases for reading single and multiple DIDs with different response types and ECU reset operations with negative responses.

Each test method is annotated with mock patches for sending and receiving messages in the UDS protocol. The tests evaluate the functionality of reading DIDs and handling various response scenarios.

Test Cases:
1. `test_rdbiSingleDIDAsciiResponse`: Tests reading a single DID with an ASCII response.
2. `test_rdbiSingleDIDMixedResponse`: Tests reading a single DID with a mixed response type.
3. `test_rdbiMultipleDIDMixedResponse`: Tests reading multiple DIDs with mixed response types.
4. `test_rdbiMultipleDIDAlternativeOrdering`: Tests reading multiple DIDs with an alternative ordering of response data.
5. `test_ecuResetNegResponse_0x13` to `test_ecuResetNegResponse_0x33`: Tests ECU reset operations with various negative response scenarios (0x13, 0x22, 0x31, 0x33).

Note: The test suite verifies the behavior of reading DIDs and handling specific responses, ensuring the correct functionality of UDS operations.
