"""
The script performs multiple operations related to ECU firmware updates using UDS communication and Intel HEX files (.ihex).
It includes functions to establish UDS connection, read data from the ECU, perform security access, transfer bootloader and application data, and execute routine controls.

Key functionalities covered by the script include:

1. UDS Communication:
    - Initializing UDS connection and executing various UDS commands such as readDataByIdentifier, diagnosticSessionControl, securityAccess, and routineControl.
    - Performing specified actions to interact with the ECU and manage firmware update processes.

2. Intel HEX File Handling:
    - Loading Intel HEX files using the `ihexFile` class to extract data for both secondary bootloader and application firmware.
    - Setting up data transfer for bootloader and application using transmit addresses and lengths obtained from the parsed Intel HEX files.

3. Data Transfer and Memory Erasing:
    - Initiating the transfer process for secondary bootloader and application by requesting data download and transferring data chunks to the ECU.
    - Performing memory erase operation on the ECU to prepare for loading the new application firmware.

4. Application Status Verification:
    - Checking the validity of the loaded application and ensuring successful execution of the firmware update process.
    - Monitoring the application status during routine control operations and handling different response scenarios.

5. ECU Reset:
    - Performing a hard reset on the ECU after completing the firmware update and application verification process for system stability.

The script combines UDS communication capabilities with Intel HEX file parsing to facilitate secure and reliable firmware update procedures for ECU devices, ensuring the integrity and functionality of the loaded software.
