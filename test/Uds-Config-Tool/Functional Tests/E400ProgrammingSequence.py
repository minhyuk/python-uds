"""
This script handles the various processes involved in downloading and transferring the Secondary Bootloader and Application binary files to an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) using UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) communication protocol. It utilizes ihex file parsing to obtain data blocks necessary for the download process, Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) key generation, routine controls, memory erasing, transfer data requests, application validation, and ECU resetting. The main block orchestrates these operations in sequence to facilitate the download and validation of firmware binaries stored in ihex files.
