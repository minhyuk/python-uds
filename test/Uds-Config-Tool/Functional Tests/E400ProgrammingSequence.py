"""
The script performs a series of operations involving the manipulation of Intel HEX files (.ihex) and UDS communication with ECU devices.
It consists of classes and functions related to reading, processing, and transferring data from Intel HEX files as well as executing specific UDS commands for ECU devices.

Key sections and functionalities covered by the script include:

1. Intel Hex File Handling:
    - Classes `ihexData` and `ihexFile` for handling Intel HEX files, extracting information from the file contents and creating data blocks.

2. UDS Communication and Data Transfer:
    - Functions for establishing UDS connection, security access, memory erasing, data transfer, routine control, and software updating.
    - Calculating encryption keys and performing sequential data transfers to the device in preparation for application loading.

3. Main Execution Flow:
    - Reading and processing an Intel HEX file containing secondary bootloader and application data.
    - Setting up UDS connection, initializing the UDS session with the device, and securely transferring the bootloader and application.
    - Executing UDS commands to ensure successful application loading and verifying the integrity of transferred data.

The script integrates HEX file parsing with UDS communication functionalities to facilitate secure and efficient data transfer processes for ECU devices.
It includes various operations to manage firmware updates and perform necessary actions on target devices, ensuring the consistency and integrity of data transfer operations.
