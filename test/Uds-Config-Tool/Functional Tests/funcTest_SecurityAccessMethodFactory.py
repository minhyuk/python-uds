"""
The script performs the configuration and setup of security access methods based on the diagnostic services defined in the provided ODX (Open Diagnostic data eXchange) file for a bootloader module.

Key functionalities covered by the script include:

1. Importing Necessary Libraries:
    - Importing required modules like ET (xml.etree.ElementTree) for parsing XML and inspect for introspecting live objects in the script.

2. Parsing ODX File:
    - Loading the specified ODX file (filename = "Bootloader.odx") and parsing it using ElementTree to extract XML elements.

3. Security Access Configuration:
    - Iterating through the XML elements to identify DIAG-SERVICE tags with SEMANTIC as SECURITY to determine security-related diagnostic services.
    - Extracting relevant attributes like PositiveResponseSuppressed to define the behavior of security access mechanisms.
  
4. Security Access Method Factory:
    - Utilizing the SecurityAccessMethodFactory to dynamically create request functions, check positive response functions, and check negative response functions based on the identified security-related services.
    - The factory methods generate appropriate functions for handling security-related actions in the bootloader module configuration.

Overall, the script automates the setup of security access methods for diagnostic services defined in the provided ODX file, ensuring the proper configuration of security-related functionality in the bootloader module.
